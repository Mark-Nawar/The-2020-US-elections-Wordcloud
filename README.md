# The-2020-US-elections-Wordcloud
<h1>Gathering more than 5000 lines of Biden's and Trump's speeches in many states and on various topics and generated a word_cloud for them each using Python data science modules</h2>
<ul>
 <li>you don't need to be a python expert to do this project this was my first real-world python project and it took me a day to get how things work
 <li> You should have basic  understanding to (amuller's world-cloud module ) make sure to give a look (https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git)

 <h3> You can create classical wordclouds using the default parameters of the word cloud object and the results will be something like this example of the KJV Bible  </h3>

Docstring:     
Word cloud object for generating and drawing.

Parameters
----------
font_path : string
    Font path to the font that will be used (OTF or TTF).
    Defaults to DroidSansMono path on a Linux machine. If you are on
    another OS or don't have this font, you need to adjust this path.

width : int (default=400)
    Width of the canvas.

height : int (default=200)
    Height of the canvas.

prefer_horizontal : float (default=0.90)
    The ratio of times to try horizontal fitting as opposed to vertical.
    If prefer_horizontal < 1, the algorithm will try rotating the word
    if it doesn't fit. (There is currently no built-in way to get only
    vertical words.)

mask : nd-array or None (default=None)
    If not None, gives a binary mask on where to draw words. If mask is not
    None, width and height will be ignored and the shape of mask will be
    used instead. All white (#FF or #FFFFFF) entries will be considerd
    "masked out" while other entries will be free to draw on. [This
    changed in the most recent version!]

contour_width: float (default=0)
    If mask is not None and contour_width > 0, draw the mask contour.

contour_color: color value (default="black")
    Mask contour color.

scale : float (default=1)
    Scaling between computation and drawing. For large word-cloud images,
    using scale instead of larger canvas size is significantly faster, but
    might lead to a coarser fit for the words.

min_font_size : int (default=4)
    Smallest font size to use. Will stop when there is no more room in this
    size.

font_step : int (default=1)
    Step size for the font. font_step > 1 might speed up computation but
    give a worse fit.

max_words : number (default=200)
    The maximum number of words.

stopwords : set of strings or None
    The words that will be eliminated. If None, the build-in STOPWORDS
    list will be used. Ignored if using generate_from_frequencies.

background_color : color value (default="black")
    Background color for the word cloud image.

max_font_size : int or None (default=None)
    Maximum font size for the largest word. If None, height of the image is
    used.

mode : string (default="RGB")
    Transparent background will be generated when mode is "RGBA" and
    background_color is None.

relative_scaling : float (default='auto')
    Importance of relative word frequencies for font-size.  With
    relative_scaling=0, only word-ranks are considered.  With
    relative_scaling=1, a word that is twice as frequent will have twice
    the size.  If you want to consider the word frequencies and not only
    their rank, relative_scaling around .5 often looks good.
    If 'auto' it will be set to 0.5 unless repeat is true, in which
    case it will be set to 0.

    .. versionchanged: 2.0
        Default is now 'auto'.

color_func : callable, default=None
    Callable with parameters word, font_size, position, orientation,
    font_path, random_state that returns a PIL color for each word.
    Overwrites "colormap".
    See colormap for specifying a matplotlib colormap instead.
    To create a word cloud with a single color, use
    ``color_func=lambda *args, **kwargs: "white"``.
    The single color can also be specified using RGB code. For example
    ``color_func=lambda *args, **kwargs: (255,0,0)`` sets color to red.

regexp : string or None (optional)
    Regular expression to split the input text into tokens in process_text.
    If None is specified, ``r"\w[\w']+"`` is used. Ignored if using
    generate_from_frequencies.

collocations : bool, default=True
    Whether to include collocations (bigrams) of two words. Ignored if using
    generate_from_frequencies.


    .. versionadded: 2.0

colormap : string or matplotlib colormap, default="viridis"
    Matplotlib colormap to randomly draw colors from for each word.
    Ignored if "color_func" is specified.

    .. versionadded: 2.0

normalize_plurals : bool, default=True
    Whether to remove trailing 's' from words. If True and a word
    appears with and without a trailing 's', the one with trailing 's'
    is removed and its counts are added to the version without
    trailing 's' -- unless the word ends with 'ss'. Ignored if using
    generate_from_frequencies.

repeat : bool, default=False
    Whether to repeat words and phrases until max_words or min_font_size
    is reached.

include_numbers : bool, default=False
    Whether to include numbers as phrases or not.

min_word_length : int, default=0
    Minimum number of letters a word must have to be included.

collocation_threshold: int, default=30
    Bigrams must have a Dunning likelihood collocation score greater than this
    parameter to be counted as bigrams. Default of 30 is arbitrary.

Attributes
----------
``words_`` : dict of string to float
    Word tokens with associated frequency.

    .. versionchanged: 2.0
        ``words_`` is now a dictionary

``layout_`` : list of tuples (string, int, (int, int), int, color))
    Encodes the fitted word cloud. Encodes for each word the string, font
    size, position, orientation and color.

Notes
-----
Larger canvases with make the code significantly slower. If you need a
large word cloud, try a lower canvas size, and set the scale parameter.

The algorithm might give more weight to the ranking of the words
than their actual frequencies, depending on the ``max_font_size`` and the
scaling heuristic.
